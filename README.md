Thank you for using our disassembler. To have the program run smoothly without any problem, we 
recommend doing the following:
- When the program asks the user to enter the starting address or ending address, we recommend
that you enter a minimum address of 2500 or above, so it doesnt influence with
our current code.
- When the program asks the user to enter the starting address or ending address, we recommend 
that you enter it in hexadecimal, therefore all cap and with a maximum of 6 digits.
- For some reason if the program executed wrong, we reccomend that you close the execute window
completely and execute it again with the correct input. By doing so the program will not crash
and work correctly.
- If you mistaken enter a low cap letter please exit the execute and execute the program again 
so that it doesnt run into any error

Problem Running across:
- ADD instruction with opcode of 0
- LSR display as ASL or ASR sometimes even with restriction
- Some LSR display as DATA even with correct requirement.

Unfinished work:
- MOVEM is currently not yet finished due to time-management and its difficulty
- LSR is currently displaying the wrong output for (a).
